## Devesh Dayal - Final Project Ideas
  
### WebVR File System

Interacting with a file system using spatial geometry rather than a 2D table hierarchy view would be an interesting challenge and potentially a novel solution to file previews / viewing meta information about files of different types. Because this would be overly complicated to link up with the actual file system associated with modern day operating systems, it can be simulated in a sandboxed environment using WebVR, with files pulled from an online storage repositories like Google Drive, Dropbox or even GitHub. While file organization and layout creation are the first main ideas that come to mind, it can easily be augmented with features that resemble existing features like split screen previews, picture in picture, file sharing over social media etc etc.

### Giant Board Game

Playing chess or monopoly, but the pieces are larger-than-life, and you stand alongside them as a piece yourself. Kind of just like you'd imagine with the giant chessboard in the first Harry Potter movie - swipe to eliminate another piece off the board and *teleport* to different tiles. Could be augmented to have a high level view as well, where you can lift up and place pieces.

### Internet Visualizer

A virtual reality web browser - why look at single pages at a time when your portal to the internet is no longer just a single window, but an entire sphere of vision? Moving to new pages or clicking links should be equivalent to moving deeper into the path that led to you where you are and moving back should do exactly that and you physically move you backwards. Content can be fragmented based on the structure of the HTML, embedding high level components into smaller custom widgets that can be dragged around on screen and interacted with normally as page elements. Waving your hand should scroll, close all tabs etc. They trickiest part will be the keyboard, but maybe a workaround like the easel on one hand in tiltbrush can be experimented with.
